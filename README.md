## Dataset

> The Prosper Loan dataset downloaded from the Udacity "Communicate Data Findings Project" dataset options page contains 113,937 observations with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income etc.


## Summary of Findings

>In this notebook I intended to observe the major loan status and some characteristics that correlate with these status.

>In the univariate visualisations I looked at the distributions of the Loan Status, Income Range, Employment Status, Home Ownership, Group members, Loan Amount and the top 10 Occupations. These showed that the majority of the data fell in to 4 loan status 'Completed', 'Current', 'Defaulted' and 'Chargedoff', the 2 major income categories where 25,000 - 49,999 and 50,000 - 79,999, majority were employed, there were slightly more home owner, most borrowers were not in groups, most requsted loan amounts were about 4,000 dollars followed 15,000 and 10,000.

> In the Bivariate visualisations I looked at the correlation between Loan status and Income Range which showed that higher income range currently had more access to loans, Loan status and Employment status showed that employed borrowers had higher access to loans, the distribution of Loan status with respect to Home ownership showed that the current loan were accessed by more home owners and Loan status with respect to Loan amount showed that 25 percent of the current loans were between 14,000 and 30,000. 

> The multivariate visualisations showed that most of the loans above 25,000 dollars were given to home owner, borrowers with credit scores above 740 and borrower rate were below 0.2 for these higher loans.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation I focused on the current loan status which correlates with higher income range, home ownership and higher credit scores.
